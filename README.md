# ArduinoD1AndD0
A very quick and very simple sketch for running some operations on your D0 and D1 (RX and TX) pins.
.
This sketch is supposed to show just how easy it is to user RX and TX pins as actual digital pins like any other.
Due to a lot of confusion if they can be used as such or not. 

### 30/1/2019
Added the Ability for the pins to be used in a 'threaded' way. As in, to have two separate operations happening at each of them at different times.
